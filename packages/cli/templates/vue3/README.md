# Storyblok Vue 3 Field Plugin

This project was created using Vue 3 and Typescript. It consists of a set of base functionalities, such as value updating, modal toggling and asset selection. This starter is intended to help developers when creating their own Storyblok Field Plugin.

## Composition API vs Options API

You can choose either option. This template is written using the Composition API, and you can view the implementation in the `src/useFieldPlugin.ts` file.

If you prefer to use the Options API, you can refer to [the Vue 2 template](https://github.com/storyblok/field-plugin/blob/main/packages/cli/templates/vue2/src/App.vue).

## Local Development

To start the project locally, simply run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## What's next?

If you want to deploy your field plugin to Storyblok, you can do so by using our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storyblok/field-plugin-cli).
