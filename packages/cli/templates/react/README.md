# Storyblok Field Plugin in React

This React project is designed to function as a Storyblok field plugin application. It showcases some fundamental features for field plugins, including value updates, modal toggling, and asset selection. The primary goal of this starter is to provide developers with a clear blueprint for creating custom field plugins.

To remove the example code, simply delete the `src/components/` directory and alter the imports and returned `JSX` in `src/App.tsx`.

For those who prefer to work with JavaScript instead of TypeScript, they can rename src/App.tsx to src/App.jsx.

## Local Development

To start the project locally, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## What's next?

If you want to deploy your field plugin to Storyblok, you can do so by using our [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storyblok/field-plugin-cli).
