# Storyblok Field Plugin with "Vanilla" JavaScript

This project was generated with `@storyblok/field-plugin-cli`.

## Usage

For development, run the application locally with

```shell
npm run dev
```

and open the [Sandbox](https://plugin-sandbox.storyblok.com/field-plugin/).

To build the project, run

```shell
npm run build
```

Deploy the field plugin with the CLI. Issue a [personal access token](https://app.storyblok.com/#/me/account?tab=token), rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.example`, open the file, set the value `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and run

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Next Steps

Set up continuous integration with the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storyblok/field-plugin-cli). Define an environmental variable `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and use the `--name` and `--skipPrompts` options as such:

```shell
npm run deploy --name $NAME --skipPrompts
```

## Clean up the boilerplate

To start from a blank state, delete the following files:

- src/components/components.js

And search for comments `DELETE THIS BOILERPLATE` comments and delete the code around them.
