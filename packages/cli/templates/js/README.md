# Storyblok Field Plugin with "Vanilla" JavaScript

This project was generated with `@storyblok/field-plugin-cli`.

## Usage

For development, run the application locally with

```shell
npm run dev
```

and open the [Sandbox](https://plugin-sandbox.storyblok.com/field-plugin/).

To build the project, run

```shell
npm run build
```

Deploy the field plugin with the CLI. Issue a [personal access token](https://app.storyblok.com/#/me/account?tab=token), rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.example`, open the file, set the value `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and run

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Manifest File for Field Plugins

The manifest file is a configuration that enhances the functionality of your field plugin. This JSON file, named `field-plugin.config.json` and located in your project's root folder, is optional but highly recommended.

The manifest file allows you to configure [options](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/plugins/field-plugins/introduction#options) for your field plugin. When developing your field plugin with the [Sandbox](https://plugin-sandbox.storyblok.com/field-plugin/), the options are applied by default. Also, the deploy command automatically applies the options in production. So, you no longer need to configure the options manually.

### Configuring a Manifest File

The options list within the file `field-plugin.config.json` should consist of key-value objects representing the essential options required for your field plugin to function correctly, along with their corresponding values. This is an example of how it should be structured:

```json
{
  "options": [
    {
      "name": "myPluginInitialValue",
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, you just need to access these options in your code like in the example below:

```js
console.log(data.options.myPluginInitialValue)
```

## Clean up the boilerplate

To start from a blank state, delete the following files:

- src/components/components.js

And search for comments `DELETE THIS BOILERPLATE` comments and delete the code around them.

## Continuous delivery

Set up [continuous delivery](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/plugins/field-plugins/continuous-delivery) with the CLI. Define an environmental variable `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and use the `--name` and `--skipPrompts` options as such:

```shell
npm run deploy --name $NAME --skipPrompts
```
