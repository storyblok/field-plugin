  This file is at the root level of this CLI package, instead of `src/`.
  
  In production, this file will be bundled into `dist/main.cjs` later,
  and we will have `dist/templates` as well.
  So the `TEMPLATES_PATH` below makes sense (current directory -> 'templates')

  In development, this file is still right next to `templates` folder. So it's still correct.
  
  If we move this file to another folder, then we need to put correct value conditionally to `TEMPLATES_PATH`.
